# Vehicle Return Inspection using AI

**How to achieve it**

Outfit each car with simple cameras and a small on-board computer to snap photos. These pictures go to the cloud, where an AI finds dings and scuffs. A language model then turns the findings into plain-English notes you can read in seconds.

## 1. Snapping the Right Photos

Every return inspection needs clear shots of the inside and outside.

- Cameras:
- Install one inside (dashboard and seats) and two outside (front and rear).
- Choose modules with at least 4 MP and autofocus so images aren’t blurry.
- On-Board Computer:
- **Jetson AGX Orin** – Superfast, handles real-time checks without delay, but draws more power.
- **Coral Dev Board** – Compact and efficient, perfect if you need battery-friendly operation.
- **Raspberry Pi 4 + Intel NCS2** – Very affordable way to experiment before upgrading.

This setup checks each photo’s clarity, tags it with the car’s VIN and location, then bundles everything up for upload.

## 2. Keeping Photos and Details Safe

Once the photos look good, they need a home online along with basic info (VIN, time, GPS).

- Cloud Storage: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage or Azure Blob.
- Metadata Database:
- **PostgreSQL** when you want a strict, organized table of all inspections.
- **MongoDB** or **DynamoDB** if you prefer flexibility in what you store.

Every image and its details travel over a secure HTTPS connection, so they stay private.

## 3. Letting AI Find the Damage

With everything stored, the real work starts: spotting scratches, dents and anything unusual.

1. **Prep Stage:**
    - Resize photos to about 640×640 px.
    - Trim away background using OpenCV so the AI focuses on the car only.
2. **Detection:**
    - Exterior dents and scratches: use a model like YOLOv8 trained on auto damage.
    - Inside seat tears or missing trim: use a segmentation model such as DeepLab v3+.
3. **Turnkey Alternatives:**
    - **Tractable** – Built for insurers, links damage to repair estimates.
    - **Inspektlabs** – 360° scans, fraud checks, real-time feedback.
    - **Ravin.AI** – Quick API, user-friendly interface.
    - **WeProov**/ **UVeye** – Fixed rigs for high-volume settings (OEM, rental fleets).

If you’ve got time to train your own models, you’ll get top accuracy. If you need a fast launch, one of these services will work straight away.

## 4. Turning Data into a Short Summary

After the AI flags an issue, the raw results aren’t customer-friendly. A language model crafts a brief, human-readable note.

- Sample Prompt:
“Inspection \#1234
Found: front bumper scratch (2 cm), left door dent (1 cm)
Write a quick summary and suggest next steps.”
- Model Choices:
- **GPT-4o** – Best for clear, detailed summaries and can even parse images.
- **Claude** – Extra safety filters to avoid odd mistakes.
- **Local LLaMA** – Runs in your own data center for full privacy.

## 5. How It All Works, Step by Step

1. The cameras snap photos and edge hardware checks them.
2. Images are tagged with VIN, GPS, and timestamp.
3. Everything uploads to your cloud storage and database.
4. A small service cleans and crops each image.
5. AI models analyze and output a list of issues.
6. A language model turns that list into a short, clear report.
7. You view photos and summaries on a simple dashboard or mobile app.

## 6. Quick Comparison Table

| Task | DIY AI Pipeline | Ready-Made Service |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Initial Setup | More work (choose hardware, train models) | Minimal (sign up, use API) |
| Accuracy | Very high with custom training | Good, varies by provider |
| Cost (Per Inspection) | Depends on compute time | Subscription or per-use fee |
| Flexibility | Fully customizable | Limited to vendor features |

With this arrangement, every returned car is checked the same way, and you get easy-to-read reports without sitting for hours. Whether you build your own AI pipeline or plug into an existing service, you’ll save time and avoid disputes over damage.
