# Problem Background: MobilityCorp

MobilityCorp is a rapidly growing provider of short-term rental vehicles for last-mile transportation, catering to city dwellers and expanding to suburban regions. The company operates a diverse fleet, including electric scooters (eScooters), eBikes, electric cars, and vans. Customers conveniently sign up, locate, and book available vehicles using a mobile app, completing trips by returning vehicles to designated parking spots. The business model relies on per-minute rentals, with additional fines for late returns or vehicles left outside proper locations.

## Current Challenges

Despite its innovative offering and growing customer base, MobilityCorp faces several pressing challenges that threaten user experience, operational efficiency, and business growth:

### 1. Vehicle Availability and Positioning
- **Mismatch between supply and demand:** Customers often find that the vehicles they need are not available in preferred locations at desirable times.
- **Fleet distribution issues:** Vehicles tend to cluster in underused zones while high-demand areas are underserved, leading to lost revenue and customer frustration.

### 2. Vehicle Charging and Maintenance
- **EV Operations:** Electric cars and vans must be plugged in for charging after use; bikes and scooters require manual battery swaps by company staff.
- **Operational burden:** Staff need timely, actionable insights about which bays require battery swaps, vehicle relocation, and maintenance visits, yet manual tracking is slow and error-prone.
- **Out-of-charge incidents:** Insufficient battery management leads to unavailable vehicles and dissatisfied users.

### 3. Customer Engagement
- **Ad-hoc usage patterns:** The majority of customers use MobilityCorp’s fleet occasionally, rather than for regular commutes or planned activities.
- **Low retention:** Without personalized, proactive recommendations, MobilityCorp risks losing users to competitors or alternative modes of transport.

### 4. Booking, Payment, and Return Logistics
- **Complex booking rules:** Cars and vans require advance booking and scheduled returns; eBikes and eScooters are open-ended and booked for shorter timeframes.
- **Return proof and feedback:** Users must submit photos to confirm vehicle returns and provide feedback on potential faults or issues, requiring a robust, user-friendly app experience.

### 5. Business Intelligence and Expansion
- **Demand forecasting:** Predicting peak demand zones and times is critical for fleet efficiency but difficult using only historical data and manual analysis.
- **Infrastructure growth:** Choosing optimal new parking locations requires careful analysis of customer habits, city zoning, competitor actions, and business projections.

### 6. AI and Technology Integration
- **GenAI potential:** Emerging generative AI tools offer solutions to predict trends, optimize fleet management, personalize customer engagement, and automate feedback triage.
- **Uncertainty in AI models:** Fast-changing AI markets, vendor pricing, and model drift introduce risk; MobilityCorp needs to validate, verify, and monitor all AI-driven processes.

## Strategic Opportunity

Solving these problems will make MobilityCorp a leader in smart urban mobility, driving:
- **Customer convenience and loyalty** through reliable availability, personalized recommendations, and seamless app experiences.
- **Operational efficiency** via data-driven fleet management, predictive maintenance, and optimized staff scheduling.
- **Business growth and intelligence** with targeted infrastructure expansion, timely usage analytics, and agile technology adoption.

A robust, flexible architectural approach—leveraging AI, scalable cloud services, microservices, and advanced analytics—is necessary to realize these goals while adapting to uncertainties and market changes.
