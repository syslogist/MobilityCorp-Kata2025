## Use Case: Real-Time Trust Calibration for MobilityCorp’s AI Systems

### Objective
To ensure safe, effective, and user-friendly operation of MobilityCorp’s AI-powered features (including the chatbot, vehicle return automation, and AI-based damage/fault detection), a system will be integrated to regularly assess and calibrate end-user and staff trust in AI recommendations.

### Workflow Integration

1. **Trust Checkpoints in User and Staff Journey**
    - After an AI-generated vehicle booking/suggestion.
    - When the AI makes automated return/damage/fault assessments.
    - Following automated route or fleet redistribution suggestions to staff.

2. **Implementation in the Technology Stack**
    - **Trust Assessment Module**: Embedded microservice or UI component presented to users or staff after any major AI-driven action.
        - Delivers a short, three-question validated trust scale (adapted for brevity and minimal disruption to workflow).
        - Collects responses with anonymized identifiers, associating scores with specific AI features and events.
    - **Data Aggregator & Analytics**: Securely stores and analyzes trust metrics over time and by context (user type, action type, time of day, etc.).
    - **Monitoring & Alerting**: 
        - Real-time dashboards for admins or compliance officers show trust trends alongside AI performance/feedback logs.
        - If trust falls below predefined thresholds (for specific features, locations, or user groups), automated alerts are generated.
    - **Feedback and Continuous Improvement Loops**: 
        - When trust issues coincide with negative performance data (incorrect recommendations, user complaints, override requests), system triggers:
            - Human-in-the-loop review or escalation.
            - Explanatory messages or model retraining recommendations for engineering teams.
    - **Actionable Reporting**:
        - Regular and event-based reports visualize trust shifts before and after key model or feature rollouts.
        - Decision-makers use reports for governance, regulatory, or marketing transparency purposes.

3. **Practical Integration Scenarios**
    - **Scenario A:** A customer ends a vehicle rental; the system performs AI-based damage analysis, delivers results, and then seamlessly offers the trust survey. Low trust scores may pause automatic fines, pending human review.
    - **Scenario B:** A staff member receives a route recommendation for battery swaps from the AI optimizer, completes or skips the task, and then rates confidence in AI suggestions.
    - **Scenario C:** When the chatbot proposes a multi-step trip plan (including booking, weather, POI), trust calibration occurs to understand if the AI’s “advice” is as persuasive or dependable as intended.

4. **Benefits**
    - Ensures ongoing alignment between AI capability and user/staff reliance, preventing both over-trust (misuse) and under-trust (disuse).
    - Provides actionable KPIs to improve models, explanations, and UX.
    - Enhances operational transparency and supports ethical, auditable AI deployment.
