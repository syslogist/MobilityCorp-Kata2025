O'Reilly Architectural Kata Q4 2025


# Problem definition

## Context
vehicle health record - shared DB
TODO

## Challenges
C1. Our customers keep complaining that the right vehicles aren’t in the right places!
- How do we know when people will want to use the vehicles?
- Can we anticipate customer needs?

C2. We have problems with our electric vehicles running out of charge
- Can we work out how to prioritise which vehicles to switch out batteries? (for bikes and scooters)

C3. We want our customers to use our services more frequently
- Right now, most of our customers just use them on an ad-hoc basis - we’d like more of them to rely on our fleet for
  regular trips like daily commutes
