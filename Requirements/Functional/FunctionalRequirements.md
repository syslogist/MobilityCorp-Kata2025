# Functional Requirements – MobilityCorp AI Mobility System

This document outlines the core functional requirements for the MobilityCorp platform, its AI-powered chatbot, admin prediction systems, and supporting infrastructure.

---

## 1. Vehicle Booking & User Experience

- Users shall register and authenticate securely via the mobile app or web portal.
- Users shall view nearby available vehicles (eScooters, eBikes, cars, vans) and their status.
- Users shall book cars/vans up to 7 days in advance for fixed durations.
- Users shall book eBikes/eScooters up to 30 minutes before pickup; bookings can be open-ended (up to 12 hours).
- Users shall unlock/lock vehicles with NFC via the app.
- Users shall view estimated cost, distance, routes, and travel times for each booking option.
- Users shall pay per minute of rental via integrated payment service.
- Fines shall be applied for late returns and vehicles returned to incorrect locations.
- Users shall submit photos as proof of return through the app.
- The system shall collect and respond to user feedback on vehicle condition or faults.

---

## 2. Fleet and Operations Management

- Vehicles shall transmit real-time GPS location, status, and battery level to the backend.
- The system shall display live locations and statuses of all vehicles to fleet operators.
- The system shall monitor designated parking bay and charger usage.
- Cars/vans shall be remotely disabled if required (e.g., lost, unreturned).
- Staff shall receive daily/real-time job assignments for battery swapping, vehicle relocation, and maintenance.
- The system shall recommend optimal routes and priorities for staff jobs.

---

## 3. AI-Enabled Chatbot & Trip Planning

- The chatbot shall accept natural language trip requests (e.g., “I want to go to the Dallas Museum”).
- The chatbot shall provide transportation options, nearest stations/vehicles, route, distance, time, and cost.
- The chatbot shall recommend food, refreshment, and POI options en route or at the destination.
- The chatbot shall present weather forecasts for the user’s planned route.
- The chatbot shall suggest similar events or places of interest near the destination.
- The chatbot shall accept and process feedback, booking changes, and support requests.

---

## 4. AI-Based Admin Prediction and Optimization

- The admin dashboard shall visualize real-time usage heatmaps.
- The system shall use AI/ML to forecast future demand hotspots for vehicle redistribution.
- The admin system shall recommend strategic placement of new parking spots using spatial analytics.
- The system shall simulate the projected impact of infrastructure or operational changes.
- Historical analytics and demand trends shall be accessible for business intelligence.

---

## 5. Vehicle Return and Validation (Return Software System)

- The "Return" microservice shall register every vehicle return event with timestamp, parking spot, and user ID.
- For cars/vans, it shall verify charging status via parking spot IoT sensor integration.
- The system shall receive and store user-uploaded return photos and IoT-captured images (exterior/interior scans).
- The Return service shall invoke AI-powered image analysis models as an internal feature/microservice to automatically detect:
    - Exterior and interior damages (scratches, dents, stains, broken fixtures)
    - Cleanliness/compliance issues
- Damage/violation findings shall be logged, trigger notifications for support/maintenance/workflow, and be communicated to both users and staff.
- Return events shall be updated with plug-in charging validation status.
- Fines, penalties, and disputes shall be processed automatically, with support agents able to override or review AI findings via dashboard.
- All decisions and findings from the AI damage detection must be logged and auditable.
- The return service shall expose API endpoints for other platform modules to query return status, validation outcome, and charge/fault findings.
- Return data (photos, sensor/AI output) shall be encrypted at rest and in transit.

---

## 6. AI Integration for Return Workflow

- AI models for return validation (image recognition, damage detection) shall be deployed as a secure, scalable sub-service (container or endpoint).
- AI service shall receive photos/images, analyze, and return structured classification (damage detected, type, severity).
- The return service orchestrates calls to AI and links output to support/maintenance escalation, user notification, and billing workflows.
- Feature flags and version control support rapid deployment/rollback of new AI verification logic.

---

## 7. Platform-wide Functional Updates

- Booking, payment, and operational modules shall now consult return service endpoints to ensure completion and validation of every ride.
- Admin dashboard integrates real-time feed of return findings, unresolved cases, and AI stats.
- System supports automated and manual review loops for disputing or escalating returns presided over by AI.
- End-to-end return/validation path now auditable across all business and compliance workflows.

---

## 8. Personalization & Engagement

- The system shall analyze user trip patterns and send personalized booking recommendations.
- The platform shall learn and adapt based on feedback, usage behavior, and user preferences.
- The chatbot shall remember preferred locations, vehicle types, and periodic journeys.

---

## 9. Payment & Compliance

- The payment gateway shall support secure, seamless transactions and refunds.
- The system shall comply with PCI DSS, GDPR/CCPA, and local data protection regulations.
- All fines, billing, and dispute resolutions shall be automated and integrated with support workflows.

---

## 10. Feedback, Monitoring & Validation

- The system shall triage and escalate urgent vehicle fault or support requests using NLP and AI.
- All critical business, booking, and payment flows shall be logged and auditable.
- The platform shall support human-in-the-loop reviews of AI output, customer support, and system decisions.
- System health, performance, and model accuracy shall be monitored and reported in real time.

---

## 11. Security & Reliability

- All data transmission and storage shall be encrypted.
- Only authorized staff shall access admin and fleet management tools.
- Third-party API failures shall be handled gracefully; users/staff shall be notified of outages or delays.
- Feature flags shall be used to control rollout of new AI features and system capabilities.
