# Non-Functional Requirements for Language Detection AI

## Top Driving Characteristics
- Performance: Detection in <300ms per message
- Accuracy: >99% correct recognition for supported languages
- Scalability: Support bursts/peak usage across regions
- Security: Prevent injection/malicious payloads in input

## Others Considered
- Observability: Log detection rates, errors, and latency
- Adaptability: Easy addition of new languages
- Testability: Automated tests for edge cases and releases
