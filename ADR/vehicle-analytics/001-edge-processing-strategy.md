# ADR 001: Edge Processing Strategy for Vehicle Telemetry

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Deciders:** System Architects, IoT Team Leads, Data Engineers  
**Related Issue/Story:** Vehicle Analytics Implementation

## Context and Problem Statement
The vehicle analytics system needs to process large volumes of real-time telemetry data from diverse vehicle types (e-bikes, cars, vans). Key challenges include:
- Intermittent network connectivity in vehicles
- Need for real-time alerts for critical conditions
- Bandwidth and data transfer costs
- Battery life considerations for IoT devices
- Data privacy and regulatory compliance

## Decision
We need to determine the optimal strategy for processing vehicle telemetry data, balancing real-time requirements with system resources and reliability.

### Forces and Factors:
- Data volume: ~1MB per vehicle per minute
- Fleet size: 1000+ vehicles
- Network reliability: 85-95% uptime
- Battery constraints on IoT devices
- Cost of data transmission
- Latency requirements for critical alerts (<5s)

## Alternatives

### Option A: Cloud-First Processing
- Send all raw data directly to cloud
- Process everything centrally
- Pros:
  - Simpler device logic
  - Centralized control
  - Easier updates
- Cons:
  - High bandwidth usage
  - Higher latency
  - Network dependency
  - Higher cloud costs

### Option B: Edge-Only Processing
- Process all data on vehicle IoT devices
- Send only aggregated results
- Pros:
  - Minimal bandwidth usage
  - Works offline
  - Lower cloud costs
- Cons:
  - Complex edge logic
  - Limited processing power
  - Harder to update algorithms

### Option C: Hybrid Edge-Cloud Processing (Chosen)
- Process critical metrics at edge
- Buffer non-critical data
- Selective cloud processing
- Pros:
  - Balanced approach
  - Optimal resource usage
  - Good offline handling
- Cons:
  - More complex architecture
  - Needs careful orchestration

## Decision Outcome
We will implement a hybrid edge-cloud processing strategy with:

1. Edge Processing:
   - Battery level monitoring
   - Tire pressure analysis
   - Critical alert detection
   - Local data buffering
   - Basic aggregation

2. Cloud Processing:
   - Advanced analytics
   - ML model execution
   - Historical analysis
   - Fleet-wide patterns
   - Predictive maintenance

### Implementation Details
- Edge devices will run lightweight ML models
- Critical alerts processed within 1s at edge
- Non-critical data batched every 5 minutes
- Local storage for up to 24 hours of data
- Compressed data transmission to cloud
