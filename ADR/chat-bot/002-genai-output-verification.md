# ADR 005: GenAI Output Verification Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Deciders:** Team Katalysis, Quality Assurance Team, Security Team  
**Related Issue/Story:** Chatbot Safety and Reliability

## Context and Problem Statement
Large Language Models can produce unreliable outputs including:
- Hallucinations (made-up facts)
- Biased responses
- Inconsistent information
- Safety-critical misinformation

This is particularly concerning for a mobility service where incorrect information could affect:
- User safety during travel
- Financial transactions
- Route planning accuracy
- Emergency response
- Legal compliance

## Decision
We need to implement a comprehensive verification strategy for GenAI outputs that balances:
- Real-time response requirements
- Safety and accuracy
- Operational overhead
- User experience
- Cost implications

### Forces and Factors:
- Response time target: < 2 seconds
- Error tolerance: < 0.1% for critical operations
- Review capacity: 100 samples/day
- Compliance requirements
- User trust considerations

## Alternatives

### Option A: Trust-and-Log
- No verification, just logging
- Pros:
  - Fastest response time
  - Minimal complexity
  - Low operational cost
- Cons:
  - High risk of errors
  - No quality control
  - Potential liability issues

### Option B: Full Human Review
- All responses checked by humans
- Pros:
  - Maximum accuracy
  - Complete control
  - Best risk management
- Cons:
  - Not scalable
  - High operational cost
  - Slow response times

### Option C: Hybrid Verification System (Chosen)
- Automated checks + selective human review
- Risk-based approach
- Continuous learning
- Pros:
  - Balanced approach
  - Scalable solution
  - Risk-appropriate
- Cons:
  - Complex implementation
  - Requires tuning
  - Some operational overhead

## Decision Outcome
We will implement a multi-layer verification system:

1. Pre-Response Checks:
```python
def verify_response(response: AIResponse, context: Context) -> VerificationResult:
    checks = [
        safety_check(response),
        consistency_check(response, context),
        factual_check(response),
        bias_check(response)
    ]
    
    risk_score = calculate_risk_score(checks)
    
    if risk_score > HIGH_RISK_THRESHOLD:
        return human_review_queue(response)
    elif risk_score > MEDIUM_RISK_THRESHOLD:
        return template_fallback(response)
    
    return automated_verification(response)
```

2. Verification Layers:
   ```yaml
   layers:
     automated:
       - syntax_validation
       - sentiment_analysis
       - safety_filters
       - consistency_checks
     
     template_based:
       - booking_flows
       - payment_info
       - emergency_responses
     
     human_review:
       - high_risk_transactions
       - safety_critical_info
       - unclear_intent
   ```

3. Monitoring System:
   ```typescript
   interface VerificationMetrics {
     responseAccuracy: number;
     falsePositives: number;
     reviewLatency: number;
     userFeedback: Feedback[];
     riskScores: Distribution;
   }
   ```

4. Implementation Details:
   a. Real-time Verification:
      - Response template matching
      - Sentiment analysis
      - Named entity validation
      - Numerical range checks

   b. Asynchronous Review:
      - Random sampling
      - User feedback correlation
      - Pattern detection
      - Continuous model training

   c. Human Review Workflow:
      - Priority queue system
      - Review interface
      - Feedback loop
      - Training data collection
