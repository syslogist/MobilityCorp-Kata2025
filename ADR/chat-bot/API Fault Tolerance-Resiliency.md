# ADR-XXX: API Fault Tolerance/Resiliency

## Context
System depends on third-party APIs for weather, POI, routing, eventsâ€”inevitable outages, latency spikes, or changes could disrupt service.

## Decision
Implement resiliency pattern in all API integrations:
- Use **circuit breakers** (e.g., Hystrix, Resilience4j) and intelligent fallback messages.
- Add retry and timeout mechanisms; report API health in monitoring dashboard.

## Alternatives
- **Assume API reliability:** Simpler, but cannot guarantee service continuity.

## Consequences
- **Business continuity:** Fail gracefully during API disruption.
- **Drawbacks:** Slightly higher infrastructure/software overhead.

## Status
Accepted
